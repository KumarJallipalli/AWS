## Switch ROLE

- How to give access to people who are outside organization
- It is using switch ROLE
- ex:
    - We have an AWS Account
        - Each AWS account is identified using Account ID, which is a 12 digit number
        - Remembering this 12 digit ID is difficult, Hence we can give an alias called Account Name to the Account ID
    - Now, a person from outside organization named Vishal require to access the S3 bucket
    - creating an IAM User & give it the S3 policy is NOT recommended as he is from outside organization
    - Hence, we will create a ROLE called Vishal Role & assign some policies
        - in the policy, It will ask for Account ID, we need to give Vishalâ€™s AWS ID
    - Now, An URL will be generated after creating the Role which is valid for only 1 hr. by default [ can be changed ]
    - Now Vishal can access the S3 bucket
    - Another way is from Switch Role â†’ select the Account Name of the Account where service is present & Role Name

NOTE:

---

- IT is recommended to use In-Line Policy for ROLES instead of Managed Policies for outside people/organization
- Why..?
    - Because, Managed Policies will have full Access yo Services
    - Inline can be made custom according to need
