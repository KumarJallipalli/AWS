NOTE:

---

- WKT, ELB is used to distribute the incoming Traffic to multiple EC2 instances across AZâ€™s
- And we/client access the ELB using URL of Domain Name
- But this URL with Domain Name is NOT the actual USABLE Domain Name
- It needs to changed to Actual USABLE Domain Name
- The Service which does this is Rout53
</aside>

## Route53

- `Route53` is a DNS service from AWS
    - DNS port number is 53, Hence Route53
- R53 contains these Records
    - In AWS, The mapped ELBâ€™s URLâ€™s & the Actual Domain Names are called Records
- R53 is Global

## Virtual Private Cloud [ VPC ]

- VPC is Regional
- only 5 VPCâ€™s per Region
- VPC is like a Virtual Data Center [ Since all the instances, DB, ELB, AZ contains within it ]
    - Since Data center is called AZ â†’ VPC is a virtual AZ
- Any 2 VPCâ€™s cannot communicate with each other [ but we can make it ]
- AWS provides default VPC [ Since it is difficult to setup for beginners/first time users ]
    - Since, VPC is at Regional Level â†’ Every Region will have default VPC

## Direct Connect

Our company will connect to AWS using Internet

- But Internet is shared network â†’ Any one can publicly access the data
    - So, i.e., why VPN [ Virtual Private Network ] is used by Companies to get secure, encrypted connection from companies to AWS
    - And VPN is also a shared Network, but much more strongly encrypted
- Hence AWS offers a service called `Direct Connect` â†’ which provides private lease line connection only to dedicated company
    - It is very Costly [ 16,000/- USD ]
    - It is much more protected than VPNâ€™s

## CloudFront

We will host the application in our nearby Regionâ€™s AZâ€™s

This will makes sure low latency for the people who are nearby the Region, But high latency to far away Regions

How to provide the Low latency in all regions..?

- We need to deploy the Application in all Regions, But it is very costly
- Hence, AWS provides CloudFront

CloudFront Service will contain Edge Locations

- Edge Locations will Cache the Applications
- So Every Time, A nearby Edge Location will respond to the request & hence reduces the Latency
- ELâ€™s are configured using CloudFront
- ELâ€™s are completely managed by AWS [ under CloudFront Service ]

Every Region will have Edge Locations

- `Edge Location` contains the cached application
- ELâ€™s are completely managed by AWS

CloudFront is used to create Distributions [ like an instance in EC2 & RDS ]

- Distributions contains configuration like
    - Origin
    - In which continents does the cache is required [ to cache the application in all those respective Regionâ€™s EL ]
- It uses CDN to distribute the application for caching
    - i.e., EL uses CDN for Caching
    - ELâ€™s are Connected with CDN
- We need to configure EL using CloudFront
- We need to give TTL
- `TTL` â†’ Time To Live â†’ ***maximum amount of time that the cached record/data can exist on a EL***
    - After the TTL spent, Application will be cached again with new data
    - Application will be cached based on TTL
- Invalidate Cache â†’ Used to forcibly cache the data immediately irrespective of TTL

Cloud Front caches both static & Dynamic Application

CloudFront used to reduce the latency across the Globe

- Since, the response to the request is sent by Edge Location, but NOT by the Origin Location

We can restrict some of the locations using *Geo-Restrictions*

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Which service will be hit first, if any request is made..?
â†’ Route53 [ Since R53 has the Mapping ], then it will redirect to the ELB 
â†’ Actually [ If CF is Used ] Route53 redirects to EL which contains the origin URL [ ELB ] configured by CloudFront [ Since EL contains the copy of ELB ]
