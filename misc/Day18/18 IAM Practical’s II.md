NOTE:

---

- In AWS Organization, who pays the bill..?
    - In an AWS Organization, the **management account** is responsible for paying the bills for all member accounts within the organization
- will there be an option for member accounts to pay bills for their own accounts
    - No, AWS Organizations doesn't allow member accounts to pay their own bills directly.
    - All billing is handled centrally through the management account, which consolidates the charges for all member accounts in the organization.
